# .NET OpenAI Samples
.NET samples for the [official OpenAI library for .NET](https://github.com/openai/openai-dotnet) with Azure OpenAI. Require [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) or later. 

## Known issues
One of the demo scenarios currently has a native dependency to [native macOS library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Emgu.CV.runtime.mini.macos). If you're using Windows or Linux, replace it with the Windows or appropriate Linux version.
